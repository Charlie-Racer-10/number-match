    <h1>NUMBER MATCH by Charles N Williams - HOW TO PLAY</h1>

    <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>

    <p>To match your number to the target number shown.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    
    <p>When you press START GAME, the game will randomly generate a target number up to the 1000s. It is your job to increment and decrement your number to the target number.</p>

    <p>Press the increment and decrement numbers to change the value of your number.</p>

    <p>The reset button resets the multipliers and your number back to 0</p>

    <p>You can type how much you can increment/decrement each time with the multipliers. Just type them in.</p>

    <p>Note: you can only increment up to a maximum of 999 at a time. No more than that.</p>

    <h2>WINNING</h2>

    <p>You win the game when you successfully match up your number to the target.</p>

    <p>After that you can either play another game (by pressing PLAY AGAIN) or quit (by pressing QUIT)</p>

    <p>I hope you enjoy the game I made!</p>
